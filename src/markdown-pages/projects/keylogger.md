**Python Keylogger** is a lightweight and cross-platform script built with **pynput** that captures keystrokes, including modifier combinations like `CTRL+K`, and saves them into timestamped log files. Intended for educational use, penetration testing, or behavior analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- ⌨️ **Multi-Key Detection**: Captures combo keys like `CTRL+C`, `ALT+F4`, `SHIFT+A`.  

- 🗂️ **Timestamped Logs**: Automatically saves logs with unique date and time filenames.  

- 🔒 **Modifier Handling**: Tracks keys like `CTRL`, `SHIFT`, `ALT` accurately.  

- 🧠 **Smart Character Capture**: Supports standard character keys and special keys.  

- 🧾 **Lightweight**: Pure Python with minimal dependencies (only `pynput`).  

- 📦 **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS wherever `pynput` is supported.
